This repo contains various code Haskell code snippets I saved while
going through
"[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)".

Some are directly copied from the book, so I could experiment with them.
Some are just functions I implemented to test my own understanding of
various concepts.

The ones I wrote myself are, no doubt, not the most perfect Haskell
out there. This repo is a learning exercise, not a demonstration of
how Haskell really ought to be used.

The repo is public in case someone else finds this stuff even halfway
useful. (Plus, I think my ego can stand the inevitable ridicule for my
ridiculous first attempts at Haskell.)
